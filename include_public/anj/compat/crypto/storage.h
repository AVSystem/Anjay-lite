/**
 * @file
 * @brief Platform hooks for external cryptographic storage.
 *
 * This header declares the API that platform integrators can implement
 * to back Anjay Lite's credential handling with a secure store or HSM.
 *
 * Typical responsibilities include:
 * - initializing and deinitializing a storage context
 * - creating and deleting key/certificate records
 * - writing data in chunks and finalizing records
 * - resolving identifiers into actual key/certificate bytes
 * - (optionally) serializing/deserializing persistence identifiers
 *
 * Which functions are required depends on build-time options such as
 * @c ANJ_WITH_EXTERNAL_CRYPTO_STORAGE and @c ANJ_WITH_PERSISTENCE.
