## Licensing Notice

### Mandatory Registration for Commercial Use

If you intend to use Anjay Lite in any **commercial context**,
**you must fill in a registration form** to obtain a **free commercial license**
for your product.

**Register** [**here**][anjay-lite-registration].

**Why is registration required?**

We introduced registration to:

- **Gain insight into usage patterns** — so we can prioritize support, features,
  and enhancements relevant to real-world use cases.
- **Engage with users** — allow us to notify you about important updates,
  security advisories, or licensing changes.
- **Offer tailored commercial plugins, professional services, and technical support**
  to accelerate your product development.

For inquiries, please contact: [sales@avsystem.com](mailto:sales@avsystem.com)

## About The Project

Anjay Lite is a lightweight version of the [Anjay LwM2M Client SDK][anjay-github],
designed specifically for highly resource-constrained, battery-powered IoT devices.
It features a minimalistic architecture that reduces memory and code footprint,
offering fine-grained control over resource usage and client behavior.

Anjay Lite is ideal for bare-metal devices without operating systems or dynamic
memory allocation. It is optimized for embedded applications such as:
- Smart water metering
- Asset tracking
- Environmental monitoring

While Anjay remains the go-to solution for feature-rich, scalable LwM2M
implementations — supporting a broad range of use cases and advanced
capabilities, Anjay Lite addresses a complementary need: delivering lightweight
LwM2M connectivity without compromise on reliability or standards compliance.

The project is actively developed and maintained by
[AVSystem][avsystem-url].

For more information and a list of supported features, see the
[Anjay Lite Introduction][anjay-lite-introduction].

**OMA LwM2M**

OMA Lightweight M2M is a communication protocol for remote device management and 
elemetry. It is designed for constrained wireless devices, where communication
efficiency impacts battery life. LwM2M supports secure bootstrapping, configuration,
and notifications over UDP or SMS using DTLS encryption.

## Quickstart Guide

To build the Anjay Lite project, run:

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

This will compile all the examples that use Anjay Lite, along with the test suite
in the build directory.

### Building and Running a Single Anjay Lite Example

To build and run a specific Anjay Lite example (e.g., from the examples/tutorial/BC-MandatoryObjects
directory), you can follow these steps:

``` sh
cd examples/tutorial/BC-MandatoryObjects
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./anjay_lite_bc_mandatory_objects <endpoint_name>
```

Replace <endpoint_name> with your desired endpoint name.

### Configuring the MbedTLS

Anjay Lite examples uses MbedTLS to implement DTLS for secure transport.
The library automatically fetches and builds MbedTLS version 3.6.0 during the
build process. You can override this default version or use a custom, pre-installed MbedTLS library if needed.

To override the default version fetched via FetchContent, set the MBEDTLS_VERSION variable:

``` sh
cd examples/tutorial/BC-Security
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DMBEDTLS_VERSION=3.5.0
make -j
```

To use your own custom-built MbedTLS (for example, with specific configuration settings):

1. Clone and build MbedTLS locally:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls.git
cd mbedtls
git checkout v3.4.0 # or another supported version
# change configuration using scripts/config.py or modify mbedtls_config.h directly
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install
make install
```

2. Build Anjay Lite using your installed version:

``` sh
cd /path/to/anjay-lite/build
cmake .. -DMBEDTLS_ROOT_DIR=mbedtls-path/mbedtls/install
make -j
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/mbedtls/install` with the actual path to your
installation.

> Anjay Lite requires MbedTLS 3.x. Versions from the 2.x series are not supported.
